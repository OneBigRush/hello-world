# hello-world
You know what it is.. the thing we all do at one point in time or another.


Just following the hello-world guide, do I really want to write a bit about myself? Sure why not. I am 39 years old, I am 6 foot 3 inches tall, I weight 145.6 pounds, I have been married for 12 years and have became a Father in the last year and It has been the best thing to ever happen to me! I finally feel like I have a purpose in life now, and that purpose is to provide my son with the best life that I can give him!
